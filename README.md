# Adobe India Hackathon – Connecting the Dots

Welcome to the **“Connecting the Dots” Hackathon** by Adobe. This challenge aims to transform how we interact with PDF documents — making them intelligent, structured, and user-aware.

## 🧠 Overview

The hackathon is divided into two key challenges:

### 🔹 Challenge 1A: Understand Your Document
Extract structured outlines (Title, Headings H1-H3) from raw PDFs in a clean, hierarchical JSON format. This enables smarter document navigation, search, and insight generation.

**Key Requirements:**
- Accept PDF input (≤ 50 pages)
- Output title and heading structure with page numbers
- JSON output
- Must run offline, on CPU only, in < 10 seconds

---

### 🔹 Challenge 1B: Persona-Driven Document Intelligence
Build a system that identifies and ranks the most relevant sections from a collection of documents based on a specific persona’s job-to-be-done.

**Key Requirements:**
- Multiple PDFs (3–10)
- Persona and job-to-be-done as input
- Output key sections and refined content
- Run offline in < 60 seconds

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- PyPDF2 (for PDF parsing)
- Docker (CPU-only, AMD64)
- JSON-based outputs

---

## 📦 Submission Includes
- Dockerfiles for both rounds
- Code to process input PDFs and generate structured output
- Sample folders and mock datasets

---

Let’s build the future of reading. ✨
